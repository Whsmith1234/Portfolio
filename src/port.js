the trustless decentralized benefits of standard decentralized marketplaces like Opensea.|

Converts images and drawings into a string of characters that can then be translated back to the image using the website. I made this when I did not have data on my phone and needed a way to send
 my friends images via text message. By storing only the pixels where colours change it allows for tiny strings to express readable drawings.

html, css, javascript, react, pwa, rust, tauri|
Being an awful procrastinator I often found myself needing a way to keep up with essays. To do this I built an essay helper using react js which splits up the process of writing and gives a live word count 
to keep me motivated working. Tauri was used to make the program a native app I could run while offline but using react I converted the site into a PWA to do the same.|

Firechat|

html,css,javascript,firebase|
Firechat was a website used to chat with friends using the same link. This way I could send a single link in an email to them and then chat to our hearts content.
 Users can choose whether to be partner 1 or 2 allowing for messages to be faked easily which helps with greater anonymity. By adding paremters to the site like ?email="YOUR EMAIL"&pass="YOUR PASS"&user=1 you can too use this site to 
 contact people with the same link.|
